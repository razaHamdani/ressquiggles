Real time spell checker - Implemented in Python

Many of us are familiar with real-time spell checkers in our text editors. Two of the more popular editors Microsoft Word or Google Docs will insert a red squiggly line under a word as it's typed incorrectly to indicate you have a problem. The lookup in a dictionary is dynamic. At some point, the error occurs and the number of possible words that it could be goes to zero.
For example, take the word foobar. Up until foo it could be words like foot, fool, food, etc. But once I type the b it's appearant that no words could possibly match, and Word throws a red squiggly line.
Your challenge today is to implement a real time spell checker and indicate where you would throw the red squiggle. For your dictionary use /usr/share/dict/words or the always useful enable1.txt[1] .
